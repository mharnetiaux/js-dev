# React

Local enviornment for devs to mess around with React. It runs a local server listening on `localhost:3000`, once you've run the following commands:

  1. `cd` into project root directory -- run `npm install`
  
  2. `npm run build` -- navigate to `localhost:3000`

# Cool Features

  es6 to es5 -- transpile es6 to es5
  
  sass -- preprocessor for css
  
  hot reloading -- your es6 and scss is compiled, and server refreshed... Just press save.
