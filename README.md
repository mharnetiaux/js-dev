# React

Local environment for Devs to mess around with React. It runs a local server listening on `localhost:3000`, once you've run the following commands:

  1. `cd` into project root directory -- run `npm install`
  
  2. `npm run start` -- navigate to `localhost:3000`

# Cool Features

  run `npm build` to publish code into a `./dist` folder

  ES6 to ES5 -- transpile ES6 to ES5
  
  SASS and LESS -- preprocessor for CSS
  
  Hot reloading -- your `JS` and `CSS` is compiled, and server refreshed... Just press save.
